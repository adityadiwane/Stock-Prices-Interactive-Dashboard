# Stock-Prices-Interactive-Dashboard
Created a interactive dashboard for closing prices of stocks listed on NASDAQ using PLOTLY's DASH framework and deployed the app developed using python and Flask to HEROKU cloud.

The app uses data from IEX cloud api to fetch the stock prices and for this application I have used free tier of the api which has limited number of requests so the app will not display results if the monthly limit is exceeded. Hence I have also included a video of how the app interface looks and functions.
